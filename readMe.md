For this project I used the Klingon translation API as well as the  NASA techpoty API. The idea is to play out a narative, your an invading Klingon ( an alien from StarTrek), You access technological specifications from the NASA API and translate it into your own native Klingon to assist in the invasion of the federation.My goal was to make two APIâ€™s interact with each other and accomplish a task, which I believe this project does.
